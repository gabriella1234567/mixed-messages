# Jungle Jabs | Random Insult Generator

This is my first portfolio project for the Full Stack Engineer career path on Codecademy. I wanted to create something that would be funny and also allow me to practice mainly:

- Drawing SVGs
- Javascript
- Animation
  The idea of the project is to have the website look like a scene with two characters having a "fight", with buttons to generate a random insult for each character.

## Project Plan

I split the project into two main sections:

### MVP

Features and functionalities to get a minimal working product, defined as:

> The minimal viable product is a web app with a simple interface (no characters) that will produce a new sentence from 3 different lists.

- Arrays with words to enable use of Math.random() to point to a random index in the array to select a word
- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Button and event listener

### Nice-to-have

Features and functionalities that are not necessary for the project to function:

> Generate two sentences instead of one, and to have it visually look like a "fight" with simple animations that trigger on button click

- SVG characters
- Animations for characters
- Generate two sentences
- Advanced CSS
